# Vertical News Slider

A jQuery and CSS-based slider module that displays news headlines on the left along with a preview image and brief description on the right. The "current" item is highlighted and switches automatically at intervals.

## Installation
To install, just include the CSS file along with jQuery and the `vertical.news.slider.js` or `vertical.news.slider.min.js` file:

    <head>
      ...
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/vertical.news.slider.css">
    </head>
    <body>
      ...
      <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.min.js"></script>
      <script src="js/vertical.news.slider.min.js"></script>
    </body>

It should work with any version of jQuery from 1.8 and up.

## Customizations
The expanded JavaScript file has lots of comments in it to indicate what everything does, so you can fiddle around with those if you want to change anything (e.g. the speed of the auto-changing or maybe you don't like that it stops auto-changing when the user hovers over the content part).
